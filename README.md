## Technologies Used

- Language: C++ 20
- Development Environment: [Visual Studio]
- Libraries Used: [STD]

## Applications

- **Classic OOP**
  - Description: Root logic example for object orianted programing.
  - File: clasic_oop
 
   ![simple design logic](clasic_oop/logic.png)
   simple design logic for example
 
- **Visitor Pattern**
  - Description: A C++ application implementing and testing the Visitor design pattern. The Visitor pattern allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is useful when a set of operations is defined on an object structure, but it is necessary to perform these operations in various ways and on different classes of objects.
